# Overview:
This analysis aims to explore various aspects of medical data, particularly focusing on demographic and clinical variables in relation to patient outcomes. The analysis is conducted using R programming language and leverages several statistical techniques, including Kruskal-Wallis tests, chi-squared tests, odds ratios, logistic regression, and survival analysis.

# Questions Explored:
## Question 1: Comparing Frequency Distributions
Numeric Variables:
Median and IQR for age and LOS (Length of Stay).
Kruskal-Wallis tests for age and LOS by death status.

# Numeric variables summary and comparison
summary_table <- ...
kw_test_age <- kruskal.test(age ~ died, data = medical)
kw_test_los <- kruskal.test(los ~ died, data = medical)
Categorical Variables:
Frequency tables and chi-squared tests for gender, vaccination, flu type, and comorbidities.

# Categorical variables summary and comparison
table_list <- lapply(cat_variables, function(var) { ... })
Question 2: Exploring Associations between Outcome and Exposures
Odds Ratio and Logistic Regression:
Calculate odds ratios and perform logistic regression for exposures "early" and "vacc" in relation to death.

# Odds Ratio and Logistic Regression
exposures <- c("early", "vacc")
for (exposure in exposures) { ... }
logistic_model <- glm(died ~ age_group + gender + ..., data = medical, family = "binomial")
Question 3: Survival Analysis
Kaplan-Meier Curves:
Create survival objects for LOS and death.
Generate Kaplan-Meier curves for early oseltamivir and vaccination status.

# Kaplan-Meier Curves
surv_obj <- Surv(medical$los, medical$died)
km_oseltamivir <- survfit(surv_obj ~ early, data = medical)
km_vaccination <- survfit(surv_obj ~ vacc, data = medical)
Cox Regression:
Perform Cox regression to analyze the impact of various factors on survival.

# Cox Regression
cox_model <- coxph(surv_obj ~ early + vacc + age_group + ..., data = medical)
Results and Conclusions:
Question 1:

Frequency distributions, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and chi-squared tests are used to assess the relationship between patient characteristics and outcomes.
Question 2:

Odds ratios and logistic regression provide insights into the association between exposures (early oseltamivir, vaccination) and patient outcomes.
Question 3:

Kaplan-Meier curves visualize survival probabilities over time, and Cox regression analyzes the impact of various factors on survival.
